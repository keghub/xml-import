# Educations Media Group XML schemas
This repository contains the schema and the relevant documentation to create feeds to easily import big amount of data.

Currently we support the following standards out-of-the-box.

## EMG XML 3.0
EMG XML 3.0 is the latest version of our XML schema.

The new format gives our partners the possibility to share more information with us. At the same time, our partners are required a lower degree of knowledge of our internal system. This is achieved by removing any reference to internal IDs that sometimes made EMG XML 2.0 cumbersome to work with.

## EMG XML 2.0
EMG XML 2.0, previously known as Studentum XML 2.0, is the earlier version of our XML schema.

It is currently considered obsolete and new partners should adopt the 3.0 version.
