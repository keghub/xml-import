## Institute
The institute node is composed by two nodes:
* `<locations />` that will contain all the institute's [locations](location.md)
* `<educations />` that will contain all the institute's [educations](education.md)

Both of these nodes can contain an unlimited amound of items, but all items must have a unique identifier.
